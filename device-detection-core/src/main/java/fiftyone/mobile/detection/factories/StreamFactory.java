/**
 * StreamFactory will at some point be replaced by {@link DatasetBuilder}
 * <p>
 * Factory class used to create a DataSet from a source data structure.
 * <p>
 * All the entities are held in the persistent store and only loads into memory
 * when required. A cache mechanism is used to improve efficiency as many
 * entities are frequently used in a high volume environment.
 * <p>
 * The data set will be initialised very quickly as only the header information 
 * is loaded. Entities are then created when requested by the detection process 
 * and stored in a cache to avoid being recreated if their requested again after 
 * a short period of time.
 * <p>
 * The very small data structures RootNodes, Properties and Components are 
 * always stored in memory as there is no benefit retrieving them every time 
 * they're needed.
 * <p>
 * A dataset can be created in several ways:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>Using a data file:
 *  <p><code>Dataset ds = StreamFactory.create("path_to_file", false);</code>
 *  <p>Where the boolean flag indicates if the data file should or should not 
 *  be deleted when close() is invoked.
 *  <li>Using a byte array:
 *  <p><code>Dataset ds = StreamFactory.create(dataFileAsByteArray);</code>
 *  <p>Where the byte array is the 51Degrees device data file read into a byte
 *  array.
 * </ul>
 * @see DatasetBuilder for a more flexible way of creating Datastores
