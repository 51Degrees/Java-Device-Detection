/**
 * As multiple threads need to read from the Source concurrently this class
 * provides a mechanism for readers to be recycled across threads and requests.
 * <p>
 * Each data set constructed using the Stream Factory will maintain a pool of 
 * readers in order to perform device lookup and retrieve various entities.
 * <p>
 * Used by the BaseList of type T to provide multiple readers for the list.
 * <p>
 * The Dataset must be disposed of to ensure the readers in the pool 
 * are closed.
 * <p>
 * Objects of this class should not be created directly as they are part of the 
 * internal logic.
 * <p>
 * The concept of the pool is slightly different to that, used in our C API. 
 * The C API also maintains a pool, but it is a pool of work sets where each 
 * work set is constructed from the data set and contains device information 
 * relevant to the device being detected. This pool only contains readers.
 * <p>
 * The number of readers created by the pool will typically be limited to the
 * number of concurrent threads in operation. As such the number of readers
 * will be relatively small and the Pool does not need to limit the maximum
 * number that can be created.
