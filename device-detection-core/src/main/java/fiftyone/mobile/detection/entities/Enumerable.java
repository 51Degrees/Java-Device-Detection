 * Class implements the logic of IEnumerable in C#.

 * file it's best to do so on the as-needed basis instead of loading 
 * everything in to memory. This class provides a way to read the integers 
 * one by one.
 * <p>
 * Objects of this class should not be created directly as they are part of the 
 * internal logic.
