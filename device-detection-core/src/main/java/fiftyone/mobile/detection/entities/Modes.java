/**
 * The modes of operation the data set can be used in.
 * <p>
 * FILE: The device data is held on disk and loaded into memory when needed. 
 * Caching is used to clear out stale items. Lowest memory use and slowest 
 * device detection.
 * <p>
 * MEMORY: The device data is loaded into memory. Offers the fastest device 
 * detection in Java managed code, but a slower startup time.
 * <p>
 * MEMORY_MAPPED: The device data is loaded into memory as a byte array. 
 * Java class instances are created when needed and then cleared from the cache.
 * <p>
 * Objects of this class should not be created directly as they are part of the 
 * internal logic.
