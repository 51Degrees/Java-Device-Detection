/**
 * A readonly list of variable length entity types held on persistent storage
 * rather than in memory.
 * <p>
 * Entities in the underlying data structure are either fixed length where 
 * the data that represents them always contains the same number of bytes, 
 * or variable length where the number of bytes to represent the entity varies.
 * <p>
 * This class uses the offset of the first byte of the entities data in the 
 * underlying data structure in the accessor. As such the list isn't being used 
 * as a traditional list because items are not retrieved by their index in the 
 * list, but by there offset in the underlying data structure.
 * <p>
 * The constructor will read the header information about the underlying data 
 * structure. The data for each entity is only loaded when requested via the 
 * accessor. A cache is used to avoid creating duplicate objects when requested 
 * multiple times. 
 * <p>
 * Data sources which don't support seeking can not be used. Specifically 
 * compressed data structures can not be used with these lists.
 * <p>
 * Objects of this class should not be created directly as they are part of the 
 * internal logic.
 *
 * @param <T> The type of BaseEntity the list will contain.
