/**
 * ASCII format strings are the only ones used in the data set.

 * Many native string formats use UNICODE format using 2 bytes for every 
 * character. This is inefficient when only ASCII values are being stored. 
 * The AsciiString class wraps a byte array of ASCII characters and exposes 
 * them as a native string type when required. 
 * <p> 
 * Strings stored as ASCII strings include, the relevant characters from 
 * signatures, sub strings longer than 4 characters, property and value names, 
 * the descriptions and URLs associated with properties and values. 
 * <p>
 * Objects of this class should not be created directly as they are part of the 
 * internal logic.
