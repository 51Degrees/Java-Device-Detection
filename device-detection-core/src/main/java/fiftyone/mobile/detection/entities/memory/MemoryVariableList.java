/**
 * A readonly list of variable length entity types held in memory. 
 * 
 * Entities in the underlying data structure are either fixed length where the 
 * data that represents them always contains the same number of bytes, or 
 * variable length where the number of bytes to represent the entity varies.
 * 
 * This class uses the offset of the first byte of the entities data in the 
 * underlying data structure in the accessor. As such the list isn't being 
 * used as a traditional list because items are not retrieved by their index 
 * in the list, but by there offset in the underlying data structure.
 * 
 * The constructor will read the header information about the underlying data 
 * structure and the entities are added to the list when the Read method 
 * is called.
 * 
 * The class supports source stream that do not support seeking.
 * 
 * Should not be referenced directly.
