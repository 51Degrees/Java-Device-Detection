/**
 * Many of the entities used by the detector data set are requested repeatedly. 
 * The cache improves memory usage and reduces strain on the garbage collector
 * by storing previously requested entities for a short period of time to avoid 
 * the need to re-fetch them from the underlying storage mechanism.
 * 
 * The cache works by maintaining two dictionaries of entities keyed on their 
 * offset or index. The inactive list contains all items requested since the 
 * cache was created or last serviced. The active list contains all the items 
 * currently in the cache. The inactive list is always updated when an item is 
 * requested.
 * 
 * When the cache is serviced the active list is destroyed and the inactive list
 * becomes the active list. i.e. all the items that were requested since the 
 * cache was last serviced are now in the cache. A new inactive list is created 
 * to store all items being requested since the cache was last serviced.
 *
 * @param <K> Key for the cache items.
 * @param <V> Value for the cache items.
 * @param <S> Source used to fetch items not in the cache.
