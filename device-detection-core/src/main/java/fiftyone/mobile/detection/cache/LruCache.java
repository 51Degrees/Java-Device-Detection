/**
 * Many of the entities used by the detector data set are requested repeatedly. 
 * The cache improves memory usage and reduces strain on the garbage collector
 * by storing previously requested entities for a period of time to avoid the 
 * need to re-fetch them from the underlying storage mechanism.
 * <p>
 * The Least Recently Used (LRU) cache is used. LRU cache keeps track of what 
 * was used when in order to discard the least recently used items first.
 * Every time a cache item is used the "age" of the item used is updated.
 * <p>
 * Cache is implemented using the doubly linked list of Nodes where each Node 
 * tracks the next and previous Node and contains a value. Cache entries are 
 * stored as a Key : Value pair.
 * <p>
 * For a vast majority of the real life environments a constant stream of unique 
 * User-Agents is a fairly rare event. Usually the same User-Agent can be 
 * encountered multiple times within a fairly short period of time as the user 
 * is making a subsequent request. Caching frequently occurring User-Agents 
 * improved detection speed considerably.
 * <p>
 * Some devices are also more popular than others and while the User-Agents for 
 * such devices may differ, the combination of components used would be very 
 * similar. Therefore internal caching is also used to take advantage of the 
 * more frequently occurring entities.
 * <p>
 * This class should not be called as it is part of the internal logic.
 * 
 * @param <K> Key for the cache items.
 * @param <V> Value for the cache items.
