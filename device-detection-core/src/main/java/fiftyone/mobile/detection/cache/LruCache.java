/**
 * Many of the entities used by the detector data set are requested repeatedly. 
 * The cache improves memory usage and reduces strain on the garbage collector
 * by storing previously requested entities for a period of time to avoid the 
 * need to re-fetch them from the underlying storage mechanism.
 * <p>
 * A variation of a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache is used. LRU cache keeps
 * track of what was used when in order to discard the least recently used
 * items first. Every time a cache item is used the "age" of the item used
 * is updated.
 * <p>
 * This implementation supports concurrency by using multiple linked lists
 * in place of a single linked list in the original implementation.
 * The linked list to use is assigned at random and stored in the cached
 * item. This will generate an even set of results across the different
 * linked lists. The approach reduces the probability of the same linked
 * list being locked when used in a environments with a high degree of
 * concurrency. If the feature is not required then the constructor should be
 * provided with a concurrency value of 1.
 * <p>
 * For a vast majority of the real life environments a constant stream of unique 
 * User-Agents is a fairly rare event. Usually the same User-Agent can be 
 * encountered multiple times within a fairly short period of time as the user 
 * is making a subsequent request. Caching frequently occurring User-Agents 
 * improved detection speed considerably.
 * <p>
 * Some devices are also more popular than others and while the User-Agents for 
 * such devices may differ, the combination of components used would be very 
 * similar. Therefore internal caching is also used to take advantage of the 
 * more frequently occurring entities.
 * <p>
 * This class should not be called as it is part of the internal logic.
 * 
 * @param <K> Key for the cache items.
 * @param <V> Value for the cache items.
