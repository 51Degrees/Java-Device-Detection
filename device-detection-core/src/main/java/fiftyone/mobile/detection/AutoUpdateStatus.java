/**
 * The Enumeration contains all possible states that the AutoUpdate process can 
 * potentially be in. Used as the return type for the AutoUpdate.
 * <p>
 * Use the return status code to determine whether any further actions are 
 * necessary. For example: if the return code is AUTO_UPDATE_SUCCESS nothing 
 * else needs to be done as the update completed successfully.
 * If AUTO_UPDATE_NOT_NEEDED was returned and you know the next update date is 
 * today, then retry update in six hours. All other status codes will indicate 
 * a problem with the update. AUTO_UPDATE_ERR_429_TOO_MANY_ATTEMPTS for instance 
 * means that your licence key has been used too many times in the last half 
 * hour interval.
 * <p>
 * For more details please see:
 * <a href="https://51degrees.com/support/documentation/automatic-updates">
 * licence keys and automatic updates</a> general information.
