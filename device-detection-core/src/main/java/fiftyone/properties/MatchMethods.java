/**
 * Enumerator of possible methods used to obtain the match. Modified to also 
 * return a numeric value associated with the ENUM entry.
 * <ul>
 *  <li>NONE No match could be determined between the target User-Agent and
 *  the list of signatures. Defaults were used.
 *  <li>EXACT The signature returned matches precisely with the target 
 *  User-Agent.
 *  <li>NUMERIC The signature returned matches the target User-Agent with only
 *  minor differences between numeric numbers.
 *  <li>CLOSEST No signature matched precisely and some relevant characters
 *  may be different between the returned signature and the target User-Agent.
 *  The Match.Confidence property should be used to determine the degree of
 *  difference.
 *  <li>NEAREST The signature returned contains all the same sub strings as
 *  the target User-Agent, but there are minor differences in position.
 * </ul>
