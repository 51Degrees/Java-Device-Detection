/**
 * Getting started example of using 51Degrees device detection match metrics 
 * information. The example shows how to;
 * 
 * 1) instantiate 51Degrees detection provider;
 * 2) pass in a single HTTP User-Agent header; and 
 * 3) obtain device Id, match method, difference and signature rank.
 * 
 * DeviceId: is consists of four components separated by a hyphen symbol:
 * Hardware-Platform-Browser-IsCrawler where each component is in turn an ID of 
 * the corresponding Profile.
 * Match method: provides information about the algorithm that was used to 
 * perform detection for a particular User-Agent. For more information on what 
 * each method means please see: 
 * https://51degrees.com/support/documentation/pattern
 * Difference: is used when detection method is not Exact or None. This is an 
 * integer value and the larger the value the less confident the detector is in 
 * this result.
 * Rank: integer value that indicates how popular the device is. The lower the 
 * rank the more popular the signature.
